### The Stanza element

A stanza is a group of lines forming the basic recurring metrical unit in a poem; or verse.

The HTML `<p>` element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.
Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing `</p>` tag.

<p> Composed of syllables </p><br>
<p> 3, 5, 3 </p><br>
<p> This poem is made of one stanza </p><br>
<p> This poem is not a standard haiku </p>
